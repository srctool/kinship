**Kinship** is a modern, open-source family tree application built to help you create, explore, and share genealogical relationships.

It fully supports **GEDCOM (.ged)** and **GEDCOM X (.json)** file input and output for compatibility with other genealogy software.

Designed to be lightweight, extensible, and user-friendly, whether you're tracing your ancestry, building a community archive, or developing a genealogy-based app.

> We strictly adhere to a binary system, recognizing only two distinct categories: Male and Female. These classifications align with the foundational concept of binary representation, similar to 1 and 0 in computational logic each holding equal and unique significance within this framework.
